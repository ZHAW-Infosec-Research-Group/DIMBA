    <string name="about_the_app_intention">DIBA is an intentionally vulnerable banking app that was
        designed to provide a realistic training ground for Android penetration testing and to learn in
        general about different things that can go wrong in apps with respect to security. Two main
        properties of DIBA are that it provides a simplified but still somewhat realistic banking scenario
        and that it contains a wide range of different vulnerabilities.

        While the communication between the client (app) and server are not the main focus of DIBAs security, you can
