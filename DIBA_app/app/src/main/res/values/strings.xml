    <string name="about_the_app_subtitle">Insecure Banking, done the right way.</string>
    <string name="about_the_app_intention">DIBA was created with the intention of feeling like any other banking app
        you could find on the playstore,
        with the key difference being that it is intentionally weak in its security.
    </string>
    <string name="about_the_app_training">In junction with the DIBAServer, it is a training opportunity for mobile
        penetration testers that contains many android specific weaknesses in varying difficulty.
        It can furthermore serve as a tool for educators, who want to create a curriculum for their students.
    </string>
    <string name="about_the_app_attacks">Most if not all parts of the app are attackable in some way, shape or form.
        While some vulnerabilities might be exploitable from within the app, others need you to use tools or even write
        your own malicious app.

    <string name="about_the_app_run_text">Run an instance of the DIBAServer on your PC, as long as it has internet
        connectivity
        you should be fine. Be aware that if your cellphone and server are not in the same network, you might have to
        port forward
        the port 8443 for it to work. Now you must fetch the ip address of your server with ifconfig (or simmilar) and
        adjust IP in the metasettings of DIBA.
    </string>
    <string name="about_the_app_run_communication">
        While the communication between the client (app) and server are not the main focus of DIBAs security, you can
