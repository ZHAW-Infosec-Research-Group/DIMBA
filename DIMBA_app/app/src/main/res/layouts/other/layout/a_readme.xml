Most if not all activities have their layout in two or three separate files. For the sake of this explanation, let's use
the invest activity.

Three files:
The drawer part: activity_auth_invest.xml
The toolbar part: app_bar_activity_auth_invest.xml
The content part: content_activity_auth_invest.xml

It works like this: The content xml is included in the toolbar xml and the toolbar is included in the drawer xml.

The file that really holds the UI of the activity is the content xml file.
